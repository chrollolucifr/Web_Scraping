# Scrapeme Web Scraping Project

This repository contains a **Google Colab notebook** and the resulting **CSV dataset** for scraping product data from [Scrapeme.live](https://scrapeme.live/shop). The project demonstrates a step-by-step web scraping workflow, data extraction, and basic exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## üìà Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The notebook includes:

- Dataset overview (`.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`)  
- Checking missing values  
- Using `.loc` and `.iloc` for selection  
- Category and tags frequency analysis  
- Stock status summary

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/USERNAME/REPO/blob/main/scraping_notebook.ipynb)

2. Run the cells step by step to:  
   - Scrape all products  
   - Create a CSV dataset  
   - Perform basic EDA  

3. CSV dataset will be saved as `scrapeme_products_full.csv`.
